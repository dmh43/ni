Resource layout map.
ni is assembled by following the instructions here. This script is also
included in the ni image itself so it can rebuild accordingly. The filenames
referenced from this file correspond to SDoc-processed entries in src/.

Note that these are just the entries for the core image. ni modifies itself
during the build process to include more extensions, each of which lives in a
subdirectory of src/.
