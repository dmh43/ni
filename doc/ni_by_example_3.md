#`ni` by Example, Chapter 3 (WIP)

Welcome to the third part of the tutorial. At this point, you've probably activated a certain amount of `ni` productivity by using Hadoop to broadcast your `ni` scripts across hundreds of cores and thousands of jobs.  You should also have a reasonable high-level understanding of how `ni` is a self-modifying quine, and how this allows it to execute across operating systems.

In this chapter, our goal is to multiply your power by introducing more I/O operations, important Perl operations including reducers, cell operations, and ni-specific functions. We'll also demonstrate `ni`'s connections to Python and numpy, Ruby, and Lisp. And we'll show how to patch one of `ni`'s weaknesses (large-scale joins) using `nfu`.

##Perl Reducers

One of the reasons that Perl has been stressed in this tutorial is for streaming reduce; reduction can also be done in Python (introduced in the next section), however, this reduction is limited by a slightly awkward syntax, and the sometimes-unfeasible prospect of needing to hold the entire stream in memory.

Reduction is dependent on the stream being appropriately sorted, which can make the combined act of sort + reduce expensive to execute on a single machine. Operations like these are (unsurprisingly) good options for using in the combiner or reducer steps of `HS` operations.

####Streaming Reduce
These operations encapsulate the most common types of reduce operations that you would want to do on a dataset; if your operation is more complicated, it may be more effectively performed using the buffered readahead and line-array reducers.

* `sr`: Reduce over entire stream
  * `$ ni n1E5p'sr {$_[0] + a} 0'`: sum the integers from 1 to 100,000
* `se`: Reduce while equal
  * `@final_state = se {reducer} \&partition_fn, @init_state`
* `sea` through `seq`: Reduce with partition function `a()...q()`
* `rc`: Compound reduce
* `rfn`: Custom compound reduce


####Buffered Readahead
These operations are good for reducing 

* `rw`: read while
  * `@lines = rw {condition}`: read lines while a condition is met
* `ru`: read until
  * `@lines = ru {condition}`: read lines until a condition is met
* `re`: read equal
  * `@lines = re {condition}`: read lines while the value of the condition is equal.

####Multiline Reducers
These operations can be used to reduce the data output by the readahead functions. Look at the input provided by the first perl statement, 

* `ni n1p'cart ["a", "b", "c"], [1, 2]' p'sum b_ re {a}'`
* `ni n1p'cart ["a", "b", "c"], [1, 2]' p'sum a_ re {b}'`

`rea` is the more commonly used shorthand for `re {a}`

* `ni n1p'cart ["a", "b", "c"], [1, 2]' p'r all {a_($_)} reb'`
* `ni n1p'cart ["a", "a", "b", "c"], [1, 2]' p'r uniq a_ reb'`
* `ni n1p'cart ["a", "b", "c"], [1, 2]' p'r maxstr a_ reb'`
* `ni n1p'cart ["a", "b", "c"], [1, 2]' p'r reduce {$_ + a} 0, reb` <- DOES NOT WORK BECAUSE BILOW WROTE IT WRONG


##Numpy Operations

Writing Perl reducers is among the most challenging aspects of `ni` development, and it is arguably more error-prone than most other operations because proper reduction depends on an input sort. 

Moreover, Perl reducers are good with data, but they're still not great with math. If you had considered doing matrix multiplication in `ni`, you'd be pretty much out of luck. 

However, `ni` provides 

#### `N'x = ...'`: Numpy matrix operations
  * Dense matrices can be transformed using Numpy-like operations
  * The entire input matrix (i.e. the stream) is referred to as `x`.
  * Example: `ni n10p'r map a*$_, 1..10' N'x = x + 1'` creates a matrix and adds one to every element with high keystroke efficiency.
  * Example `ni n10p'r map a*$_, 1..10' N'x = x.T'`
  
What `ni` is actually doing here is taking the code that you write and inserting it into a Python environment (you can see the python used with `ni e[which python]`

Any legal Python script is allowable, so if you're comfortable with `pandas` you can execute scripts like:

`ni ... N'import pandas as pd; df = pd.DataFrame(x); ... ; x = df.reset_index().values' ...`

The last line is key, because the data that is streamed out of this operation must be stored in the variable `x`.

Also, like other operators, `N'...'` requires at least a row for input. `ni N'x = random.rand(size=(5,5)); x = dot(x, x.T)'` will return nothing, but adding a dummy row `ni n1N'x = random.rand(size=(5,5)); x = dot(x, x.T)'` will.

This is not (yet) the cleanest or most beautiful syntax [and that matters!], but it works.


##`ni` Philosophy and Style

####`ni` demands expertise

####Conciseness matters; readability to the uninitiated does not.
`ni` spells should be beautiful

####Outsource hard jobs to more appropriate tools.
The most obvious 

Some jobs that are difficult for `ni`:
* Sorting
* Matrix Multiplication
* SQL Joins

Here's how `ni` solves those:
* Hadoop Streaming
* Numpy Operations
* HDFS Joins



####`ni` is a domain-specific language; its domain is processing single lines and chunks of data that fit in memory

* Because of this philosophy, `ni` is fantastic for data munging and cleaning.
* Because of this philosophy, large-scale sorting is not a `ni`ic operation, while gzip compression is.
* Because of this philosophy, `ni` relies heavily on Hadoop for big data processing. Without Hadoop, most sufficiently complicated operations become infeasible from a runtime perspective once the amount of data exceeds a couple of gigabytes, uncompressed.



##Intermediate Column Operations
We can weave together row, column, and Perl operations to create more complex row operations. We also introduce some more advanced column operators.

* `w`: Append column to stream
  * `$ ni <data> w[np'a*a']`
  * `w` will add columns only up to the length of the input stream
* `W`: Prepend column stream
  * `$ ni <data> Wn` - Add line numbers to the stream (by prepending one element the infinite stream `n`)
  * `W` will add rows only up to the length of the input stream
* `v`: Vertical operation on columns
  * **Important Note**: As of 2016-12-23, this operator is too slow to use in production.
  



##JSON I/O
*  `p'json_encode {<row to JSON instructions>}`: JSON Encode
  *  The syntax of the row to JSON instructions is difficult; I believe `ni` will try to interpret value as a `ni` command, but every other unquoted piece of text will be interpreted as 
  *  Here's an example:
  
```
ni //license FWpF_ p'r pl 3' \
     p'json_encode {type    => 'trigram',
                    context => {w1 => a, w2 => b},
                    word    => c}' \>jsons
```

* `D:<field1>,:<field2>...`: JSON Destructure
  * `ni` implements a very fast JSON parser that is great at pulling out string and numeral fields.
  * As of 2016-12-24, the JSON destructurer does not support list-based fields in JSON.

##Directory I/O


Start by making some data:

```
$ rm -rf dir_test && mkdir dir_test
$ echo "hello" > dir_test/hi
$ echo "you" > dir_test/there
```

Let's start with `$ ni test`

```
dir_test/hi
dir_test/there
(END)
```

`ni` has converted the folder into a stream of the names of files (and directories) inside it. You can thus access the files inside a directory using `\<`.

`$ ni dir_test \<`

yields:

```
hello
you
(END)
```

`ni` also works with the bash expansion operator `*`.

For example, `ni dir_test/*` yields:

```
hello
you
(END)
```

`ni` is able to go to the files directly becasue it is applies bash expansion first; bash expansion generates the file paths, which `ni` is then able to interpret.

```
$ ni --explain dir_test/*
["cat","dir_test/hi"]
["cat","dir_test/there"]
```




##Multiline Selection Operators


* `a_` through `l_`: Multiline Selection operations 
  * Data closures are transferred as an array of lines; in order to access data from a specific column of the data closure, you will need to use multiline operators `a_` through `l_`, which are the multilineanalogs to the line-based operators `a/a()` through `l/l()`.
  * `ni ::data[n1p'cart [1,2], [3,4]'] n1p'a_ data'` works, because `a_` is operating on each element of the array.
  * `ni ::data[n1p'cart [1,2], [3,4]'] n1p'a(data)'` and `ni ::data[n1p'cart [1,2], [3,4]'] n1p'a data'` will raise syntax errors, since `a/a()` are not prepared to deal with the more than one line data in the closure.

 






##Advanced Row and Column Operations
* `j` - streaming join
  * Note that this join will consume a single line of both streams; it does **NOT** provide a SQL-style left or right join.
* `Y` - dense-to-sparse transformation
  * Explodes each row of the stream into several rows, each with three columns:
    * The index of the row that the input data that came from
    * The index of the column that the input data came from
    * The value of the input stream at the row + column specified by the first two columns.
* `X` - sparse-to-dense transformation
  * `X` inverts `Y`; it converts a specifically-formatted 3-column stream into a multiple-column stream.
  * The specification for what the input matrix must look like is described above in the `Y` operator.
  
  

##Things other than Perl 

Look, these are here, and if it helps you get started with `ni`, great. But `ni` is written in Perl, for Perl, and in a Perlic style. Use these, but go learn Perl.

*  `m'<...>'`: Ruby
   * applies the Ruby snippet `<...>` to each row of the stream 
*  `l'<...>'`: Lisp
   * applies the Lisp snippet `<...>` to each row of the stream
